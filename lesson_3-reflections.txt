1) When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working collaboratively with other people, working on the same project on multiple computers,
or when you may need feedback on a project.

2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

So you have control - there may have been changes made to a file by a third
party that you don't want to include in the file you are working on 
locally. 

2) Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another

A branch points to a linear history of commit data.

A fork is a clone of a repository made through GitHub. It clones the 
repository of a project you are working on, into your GitHub account.

A clone is a copy of a remote repository from a GitHub repository, or anyt
remote server.

3) What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the
remote stoted locally?

So that if you are working on a problem offline, you won't lose track of
what you are working on.

4) How would you collaborate without using git or github? What would be 
easier, and what would be harder?

You could use google docs or another service to share files. It would be
hard to commit/make logical changes and log them on the fly, collaborate 
over small changes and communicate about small sections of code.

5) When wold you want to make changes in a seperate branch rather than
directly in the master? What benefits does each approach have?

Making changes in a brach allows you to make changes without effecting the 
master branch so you can test out an idea, and/or collaborate on a problem
get feedback before merging those chnages with the orginal master branch.
