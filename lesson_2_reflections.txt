1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do this?

When you initialize a repository, git creats a .git file which allows you
to start tracking changes in the files of the repository. 

2) HOw is the staging area different from the working directory and respository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is preliminary, so no changes to the staging area are loged to the commit log. This allows you to make changes, and add/remove files you want to commit before it's loged.
